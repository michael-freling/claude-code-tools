The pre-commit hooks have failed. You need to fix the errors and ensure all checks pass.

## Pre-commit Error Output

{{.}}

## Instructions

1. Analyze the error output above carefully
2. Fix all issues reported by the pre-commit hooks
3. DO NOT skip or ignore any errors
4. Ensure your fixes address the root cause, not just symptoms
5. Run the fixes to completion
6. Verify all tests still pass after your fixes

Common issues to check:
- Code formatting (go fmt, gofmt)
- Linting issues (golangci-lint, go vet)
- Import organization
- File permissions
- Trailing whitespace
- YAML/JSON syntax
- Merge conflicts

## Output Format

After fixing the errors, output a summary as JSON in a code block:
```json
{
  "filesChanged": ["file1.go", "file2.go"],
  "linesAdded": 10,
  "linesRemoved": 5,
  "testsAdded": 0,
  "summary": "Fixed pre-commit errors: [brief description of fixes]",
  "nextSteps": []
}
```

IMPORTANT: Fix ALL errors. Do not proceed until every pre-commit check passes.
