CRITICAL: Your response MUST be ONLY valid JSON. Do NOT include any markdown, explanations, or text outside the JSON object.

Split changes into multiple pull requests for easier review.

## Metrics
Lines: {{.Metrics.LinesChanged}}, Files: {{.Metrics.FilesChanged}}

## Recent Commits
{{range .Commits}}
- {{.Hash}} - {{.Subject}}
{{end}}

## Instructions
1. Choose strategy: "commits" (cherry-pick commits) or "files" (specific files)
2. Create parent PR to track overall feature
3. Split into child PRs that are independently reviewable
4. MUST include at least ONE child PR (never empty childPRs array)

## Split Guidelines
- Child PRs are chained: Child 2 based on Child 1, etc.
- Order by dependency: foundational changes first
- Group by logical boundaries or domain
- All commits/files must be accounted for

## Required JSON Format
{
  "strategy": "commits",
  "parentTitle": "Parent PR: [description]",
  "parentDescription": "Split into:\n- Child 1: ...\n- Child 2: ...",
  "childPRs": [
    {
      "title": "[Part 1/N] Title",
      "description": "## Summary\n...\n\n## Changes\n...",
      "commits": ["abc123"],
      "files": []
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Why this split makes sense"
}

REMINDER: Output ONLY JSON. childPRs array MUST have at least 1 element.
