The CI checks have failed on your pull request. You need to fix the errors and ensure all CI jobs pass.

## CI Failure Output

{{.}}

## Instructions

1. Analyze the CI failure output above carefully
2. Identify which jobs failed and why:
   - **Failed jobs**: These have actual errors that need code fixes
   - **Cancelled jobs**: These were cancelled due to infrastructure issues (workflow superseded, concurrency settings, manual cancellation, or runner timeouts) - NOT code problems
3. For FAILED jobs: Fix all issues reported by the CI system
4. For CANCELLED jobs: These typically don't require code fixes. If you see only cancelled jobs with no actual failures:
   - Verify tests pass locally
   - If tests pass locally, push an empty commit to re-trigger CI: `git commit --allow-empty -m "Re-trigger CI" && git push`
5. DO NOT skip or ignore actual errors
6. Ensure your fixes address the root cause, not just symptoms
7. Run tests locally to verify fixes before pushing
8. Push your fixes to update the PR

Common CI failures:
- Unit tests failing
- Integration tests failing
- Build failures
- Linting issues not caught by pre-commit
- Race conditions
- Flaky tests
- Missing dependencies
- Environment-specific issues

Common reasons for CANCELLED jobs (NOT code issues):
- A newer commit triggered a new workflow run, cancelling the previous one
- GitHub Actions concurrency settings caused older runs to be cancelled
- Someone manually cancelled the job
- Runner issues or timeouts occurred

## Output Format

After analyzing and fixing the errors (or determining no fixes are needed), output a summary as JSON in a code block:
```json
{
  "filesChanged": ["file1.go", "file2.go"],
  "linesAdded": 15,
  "linesRemoved": 8,
  "testsAdded": 2,
  "summary": "Fixed CI failures: [brief description of fixes]",
  "nextSteps": ["Push fixes to PR"]
}
```

If only cancelled jobs exist and tests pass locally:
```json
{
  "filesChanged": [],
  "linesAdded": 0,
  "linesRemoved": 0,
  "testsAdded": 0,
  "summary": "CI jobs were cancelled due to infrastructure reasons, not code issues. Tests pass locally.",
  "nextSteps": ["Push empty commit to re-trigger CI"]
}
```

IMPORTANT:
- Fix ALL actual CI failures (failed jobs)
- For cancelled jobs with no failures, verify tests pass locally and re-trigger CI
- Ensure all tests pass locally before pushing
- Do not skip or disable failing tests
- Address root causes, not symptoms
