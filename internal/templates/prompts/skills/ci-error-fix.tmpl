Create Claude Code skills by following the official reference: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills

When you get an error on CI, follow the following approach.

At first, understand the cause of an error.
Then check if the CI on the main branch has the same error or not.

If there is no CI error, the error was added by your change, so follow to fix the cause of an error.

1. Investigate the cause of an error from the current codebase
2. Reproduce an error locally
3. Fix the cause of an error as well as update the test codes
4. Verify the fix works

Repeat until the CI passes successfully.
