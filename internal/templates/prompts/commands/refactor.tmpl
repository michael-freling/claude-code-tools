### Slash commands: feature, fix, and refactor

Create following Claude Code commands, to write an instruction to Claude Code for each workflow.
The overview of each command is following:

4. **refactor** command: refactor the codebase. Before doing the refactoring, cleaning unnecessary codes where agents will change.

**feature and refactor commands**

1. Analyze existing codebase and architecture.
2. Create new design and plan changes for new feature or refactoring.
3. Get a review for the design and the plan.
4. Confirm the design, whether backward compatibility is required or not, and plan to the user to see if the plan is good. Do not start until you get an approval.
5. Once you get an approval, make sure you update a local main branch is the same as the remote main branch. If not, recreate the local main branch.
6. If there are multiple phases
    1. Create an epic PR to the default branch with an empty commit.
    2. For each phase, subagents must make each change in a worktree. New worktree msut be under `../worktrees`. And create a sub PR to the branch of the epic PR.
    3. Fix any CI errors until CI passes. To confirm the result of CI, wait for a long time because CI is slow. For example, wait for a minute to start a job, and wait for at least every 5 minutes to complete.
7. If there is a single phase subagents must make each change in a worktree. New worktree must be under `../worktrees`. Then create a PR and fix any CI errors until CI passes while waiting for a long time.
