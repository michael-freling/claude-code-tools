# Claude Code Slash Command and Skill Guidelines for Coding

This is coding rules to generate Claude Codes' commands and skills.

The commands and skills have to be created with following documents:

## General Claude Code's slash commands and skill guides

1. Create the slash commands of Claude Code by analyzing the usages and best practices on the Internet at first, including https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands
    1. Add `$ARGUMENTS` or `$1`, `$2` for each parameter
    2. Add `allowed-tools`, `argument-hint`, and `description` for each slash command at least.
2. Create the skills of Claude Code by analyzing the usages and best practices on the Internet at first, including https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills

    2. Add `examples.md` for complex examples
    3. Add `Version History`
3. Ask users to install all MCP servers that users should install on each slash command or skill.


### Slash command: document-guideline

Create a Claude Code's slash command `document-guideline` to write a document `.claude/docs/guideline.md` by following codes

1. Architect sub agent must analyze codebase and output a guideline
2. Guideline must include at least an architecture, API designs, data models, design patterns, coding conventions, and coding best practices.
