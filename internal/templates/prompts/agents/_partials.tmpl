{{/* Shared rules used across agent prompt templates */}}

{{define "COMMON_RULES"}}
An subagent follows these rules at least:

- Read a guideline file **.claude/docs/guideline.md**
- Simplicity is the most important thing.
- When installing applications, libraries, or tools, always check and use the most latest and stable version with compatibility with existing systems.
- DO NOT USE general terms like shared, common, utils or info for naming variables, functions, classes, tables, and so on.
- Set proper owners and permissions instead of setting 777 to files or directories
