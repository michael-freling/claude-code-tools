Here's my analysis:

First, let me show you the invalid JSON:

```json
{
  "invalid": "missing closing brace"
```

Now here's the correct plan:

```json
{
  "summary": "Add JWT authentication to the application",
  "contextType": "feature",
  "architecture": {
    "overview": "Implement JWT-based authentication system",
    "components": ["auth middleware"]
  },
  "phases": [],
  "workStreams": [],
  "risks": [],
  "complexity": "small",
  "estimatedTotalLines": 50,
  "estimatedTotalFiles": 2
}
```

That should work better.
