You are refactoring the code that was implemented according to the following plan:

## Plan Summary
{{.Summary}}

## Architecture
{{.Architecture.Overview}}

Components:
{{range .Architecture.Components}}- {{.}}
{{end}}

## Instructions
1. Review all implemented code for quality and maintainability
2. Refactor to improve:
   - Code organization and structure
   - Error handling patterns
   - Test coverage and quality
   - Documentation and comments
   - Performance if applicable
3. Ensure all tests still pass after refactoring
4. Follow Go best practices and idioms
5. Maintain backward compatibility

## Focus Areas
- Reduce code duplication
- Improve naming and clarity
- Enhance error messages
- Optimize imports and dependencies
- Ensure consistent coding style
- Remove any dead code or commented-out code

## Output Format
After completing the refactoring, output a summary as JSON in a code block:
```json
{
  "filesChanged": ["file1.go", "file2.go"],
  "improvementsMade": [
    "Improved error handling in X",
    "Refactored Y for better readability",
    "Enhanced test coverage for Z"
  ],
  "summary": "Brief summary of refactoring changes"
}
```

Remember:
- Keep changes focused and incremental
- Preserve functionality while improving code quality
- Update tests if necessary to reflect refactored code
- Ensure all error paths are well-tested
