You are implementing the following plan:

## Plan Summary
{{.Summary}}

## Architecture
{{.Architecture.Overview}}

Components:
{{range .Architecture.Components}}- {{.}}
{{end}}

## Phases
{{range .Phases}}
### {{.Name}}
{{.Description}}
Estimated: {{.EstimatedFiles}} files, {{.EstimatedLines}} lines
{{end}}

## Work Streams
{{range .WorkStreams}}
### {{.Name}}
{{range .Tasks}}- {{.}}
{{end}}{{if .DependsOn}}
Dependencies: {{range .DependsOn}}{{.}} {{end}}
{{end}}
{{end}}

## Risks to Consider
{{range .Risks}}- {{.}}
{{end}}

## Instructions
1. Implement all components according to the plan
2. Follow existing codebase patterns and conventions
3. Write comprehensive tests for all new code
4. Ensure all error cases are handled
5. Add appropriate documentation

## Verification Process
After you implement the changes:
1. Commit all your changes with descriptive commit messages
2. Pre-commit hooks will automatically run to check code quality
3. If pre-commit fails, you will receive the error output and must fix all issues
4. After pre-commit passes, CI will run to verify the build and tests
5. If CI fails, you will receive the failure details and must fix all issues
6. This process continues until all checks pass

Make sure your implementation:
- Passes all linting and formatting checks
- Compiles without errors
- All tests pass

## Output Format
After completing the implementation, output a summary as JSON with the following structure:
{
  "filesChanged": ["file1.go", "file2.go"],
  "linesAdded": 350,
  "linesRemoved": 20,
  "testsAdded": 15,
  "summary": "Brief summary of what was implemented",
  "nextSteps": ["optional", "next", "steps"]
}

Focus on:
- Clean, maintainable code
- Comprehensive error handling
- Table-driven tests with good coverage
- Clear comments only where necessary
