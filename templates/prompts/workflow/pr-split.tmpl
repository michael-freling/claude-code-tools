You need to split the current changes into multiple pull requests for easier review.

## Change Metrics
- Lines Changed: {{.LinesChanged}}
- Files Changed: {{.FilesChanged}}

{{if .FilesAdded}}
### Files Added
{{range .FilesAdded}}- {{.}}
{{end}}
{{end}}

{{if .FilesModified}}
### Files Modified
{{range .FilesModified}}- {{.}}
{{end}}
{{end}}

{{if .FilesDeleted}}
### Files Deleted
{{range .FilesDeleted}}- {{.}}
{{end}}
{{end}}

## Instructions
1. Analyze the changes and identify logical groups
2. Create a parent PR that will track the overall feature
3. Split changes into child PRs that:
   - Are independently reviewable
   - Have clear boundaries
   - Can be merged sequentially
   - Each address a specific aspect of the change

## Guidelines
- Each child PR should be <100 lines or <10 files when possible
- Child PRs should have dependencies in the right order
- Parent PR should reference all child PRs
- Each PR should have a clear, descriptive title and description

## Output Format
Output the PR split plan as JSON in a code block:
```json
{
  "parentPR": {
    "number": 0,
    "url": "",
    "title": "Parent PR title describing the overall feature",
    "description": "Parent PR description with links to child PRs"
  },
  "childPRs": [
    {
      "number": 0,
      "url": "",
      "title": "Child PR 1 title",
      "description": "Child PR 1 description"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Brief summary of the split strategy"
}
```

After creating the PRs, fill in the actual PR numbers and URLs in the JSON output.
